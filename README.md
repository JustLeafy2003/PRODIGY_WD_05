Repository for the Web Developer task #5 for my internship at Prodigy Infotech: a weather application.

This website features only one page, where the user is prompted to enter any location. This way, they will be able to find out the weather of the prompted location, along with a few other things:
- Temperature, featured both in celsius and fahrenheit.
- Humidity levels
- Wind speed
- 5 day forecast, with weather being displayed, then temperature

The background color of both of the website and the weather box change, depending on the different weathers. For example, if someone put "Scotland" and received a "clear sky" weather, the website background color becomes light blue. If they then put "Bern" and received a "broken clouds" weather, the website background color becomes gray.

The weather API that is being used is from OpenWeatherMap.
